# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Discription
This is an E-Commerce back end. This application helped me futher my knowledge of mysql and sequelize. I was able to practice using ORM to have API routes preform RESTful CRUD operations.

## Usage
1. Run `mysql`
2. Run `SOURCE db/schema.sql`
3. Run `quit`
4. Run `npm run seed`
5. Run `npm start`
